    "description": "This is a simple demo version of a mod that I have been planning for many, many months now. This proof-of-concept may seem underwhelming, but I am excited to grow this mod; and you can help greatly, even if you can't code!<LINE>To experience the demo, restart Survivor's campaign. If you just want to play around freely with the features of this mod, then select your abilities in the Remix config menu for this mod, and play in any campaign except Survivor's.<LINE><LINE>The primary goal of this mod is to make exploring Rain World fun. This will be done by adding Metroidvania-style upgrades and abilities to be found throughout the world. To compensate for this, the world will be almost entirely re-arranged, and new challenges will be added.<LINE>My hope for this mod is to incorporate a great many community-made region mods. I am frustrated that there are so many amazing region mods, yet I cannot much enjoy exploring them simply for the sake of exploring. But if regions had collectible upgrades, keys to other regions, and maybe even boss fights...? Sounds way more fun.<LINE><LINE>If you are interested in this project, let me know. Almost anyone can help with this mod somehow: Playtesting, Artwork, Spritework, Music, Story conceptual design, Mechanic suggestions, Coding (creatures, items, misc): all of that would help immensely. But especially, designing the world map (finding which regions to use and/or rearranging them) - I need help with that.<LINE>...anyone want to design a Metroidvania game map?",
